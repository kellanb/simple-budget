# Documentation

This folder contains all project documentation organized into logical categories.

## Structure

### `/agent-analyses`
Comparative analyses of different AI-generated implementation plans for the Yearly Forecast feature. These documents evaluate and compare plans from different AI agents (GPT, Opus, Gemini, Droid) to determine the best approach.

**Files:**
- `agent-plans-analysis_droid.md` - Droid's analysis comparing all four plans
- `agent-plans-analysis_gemini.md` - Gemini's analysis comparing all four plans
- `agent-plans-analysis_gpt.md` - GPT's analysis comparing all four plans
- `agent-plans-analysis_opus.md` - Opus's analysis comparing all four plans

### `/implementation-plans`
Detailed implementation plans for the Yearly Forecast feature from different AI agents. Each plan provides a complete technical specification including data models, API design, UI/UX, and implementation steps.

**Files:**
- `PLAN-yearly-forecast_droid.md` - Droid's implementation plan
- `PLAN-yearly-forecast_gemini.md` - Gemini's implementation plan
- `PLAN-yearly-forecast_gpt.md` - GPT's implementation plan
- `PLAN-yearly-forecast_opus.md` - Opus's implementation plan

### `/project`
Core project documentation including the original project plan and conversation history.

**Files:**
- `PLAN.md` - Original project plan for the Simple Budget application
- `CHAT.md` - Conversation history from the initial project planning session
